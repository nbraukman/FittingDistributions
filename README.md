# FittingDistributions

Examples fitting distribution curves to the histograms in the ZbosonSelector in the CoffeaProcessor notebook.

You will still need to be in the `ttgenv` virtual environment to run the notebook. In Blueshark, run:
```
source ~/TopAnalysisExample/ttgenv/bin/activate
```
to activate the environment from outside of the `TopAnalysisExample` directory.
