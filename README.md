Examples fitting distribution curves to the histograms in the ZbosonSelector in the CoffeaProcessor notebook.

You will still need to be in the `ttgenv` virtual environment to run the notebook. In Blueshark:
`cd TopAnalysisExample/
source ttgenv/bin/activate
`
Then change to this directory or a directory above it before running the `jupyter notebook` command.
